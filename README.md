# PMU-Project
This is a project to recreate a PMU card game in C#


Selected Card Set Definition (PMU):

  Goal of the game = it's a horse race at the beginning the 4 valets are on the starting line we put cards to hide all along the race to define the stages
Each player chooses a horse and rides it betting on “the number of glasses, sports pump, money”.
The game begins we take the packer and we draw a card each time your color is drawn your horse advances, each time a new course stage is reached we return The card hides and the horse of this color moves back t a case the first to win distributes their bets to the losers the last end up with double.
